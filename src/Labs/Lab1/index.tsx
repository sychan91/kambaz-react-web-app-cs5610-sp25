                <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
                Text documents are often broken up into several sections and
                subsections. Each section is usually prefaced with a short
                title or heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the
                section it precedes. For instance this paragraph is preceded by
                the heading Heading Tags. The font of the section headings are
                usually larger and bolder than their subsection headings. This
                document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML
                Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags can
                be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as
                large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different sizes:
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and
                h6 is the smallest heading.

                <p id="wd-p-1">
                    This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set
                    of sentences with vertical spaces to make the text
                    easier to read. Browsers ignore vertical white
                    spaces and render all the text as one single set
                    of sentences. To force the browser to add vertical
                    spacing, wrap the paragraphs you want to separate
                    with the paragraph tag
                </p>
                <p id="wd-p-2">
                    This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format vertical gaps between
                    long pieces of text like this one.
                </p>
                <p id="wd-p-3">
                    This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white gap between the
                    paragraph above and this paragraph, by default browsers render them as one contiguous
                    piece of text as shown here on the right.
                </p>
                <p id="wd-p-4">
                    This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag to tell browsers
                    to render the gaps.
